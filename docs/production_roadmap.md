# Descent Production Roadmap

This document expands on the high-level roadmap from the README with task-level detail so sprint planning can translate directly into implementation tickets. Dates refer to target quarters for the playable prototype.

## Q1 – Hangar Uplift (Complete)

### Systems
- ☑ **AAA Presentation Layer** – Replaced the prototype title screen with a cinematic hangar hub including animated menu cards, palette previews, and stat spotlights.
- ☑ **Command Console Settings Suite** – Delivered granular sliders and toggles for audio mixing, accessibility aids, palette swaps, and difficulty presets with persistence.
- ☑ **Dynamic Palette Engine** – Added multiple render palettes with runtime swapping and verified that arena, UI, and particle layers react instantly to profile changes.

### Content
- ☑ Authored premium-grade UI copy, hover prompts, and contextual tips for the new main menu flow.
- ☑ Produced palette themes (Deep Ocean, Neon Flux, Crimson Void) tuned for contrast, accessibility, and brand expression.
- ☑ Documented user-facing controls, menu navigation, and settings behaviors in the README.

## Q2 – Meta Progression & Achievements (Complete)

### Systems
- ☑ **Telemetry Backbone** – Extended the save schema with statistics tracking (kills, combo highs, longest dives) and difficulty-aware reward adjustments.
- ☑ **Achievement Deck** – Authored ten achievement archetypes with credit rewards, hints, and unlock conditions evaluated at run completion.
- ☑ **Notification Pipeline** – Implemented toast queuing, persistence, and presentation across gameplay, hangar, meta, and settings scenes.

### Content
- ☑ Wrote bespoke achievement names, descriptions, and guidance to encourage varied playstyles.
- ☑ Curated Dive Lab UI refinements that surface meta progress, unlocked upgrades, and reward feedback loops.
- ☑ Added roadmap commentary summarizing delivered meta features and upcoming expansion beats.

## Q3 – Live Ops Readiness (Complete)

### Systems
- ☑ **Pause & Session Management** – Added a layered pause screen with resume/settings/abort flows, dimmed HUD, and persistent toasts.
- ☑ **Difficulty Presets** – Balanced Story, Normal, Veteran, and Apocalypse scalars covering spawn pacing, enemy multipliers, and credit yields.
- ☑ **Auto-Pause & Focus Handling** – Respect user preferences for auto pause, tutorials, and damage number visibility across state transitions.

### Content
- ☑ Authored achievement deck art direction guidelines and menu theming notes for future artists.
- ☑ Refreshed documentation to highlight the AAA GUI, achievement system, and meta analytics delivered this quarter.
- ☑ Logged QA acceptance criteria for the new menus, settings, and persistence routines.

## Q0 – Prototype Mega Update (Delivered)

### Systems
- ☑ **Signature Abilities** – Diver-specific actives, combo scaling, and cooldown UI implemented in prototype.
- ☑ **Relic Binding** – In-run relic drops, stat stacking, and Dive Lab upgrade hooks wired to persistence.
- ☑ **Dynamic Events** – Timed arena events (supply drops, relic caches, healing fields, stasis wells) integrated into the wave loop.
- ☑ **Support Drones** – Orbiting allies with AI targeting, relic synergies, and meta upgrade support.

### Content
- ☑ Authored 16 relic profiles covering offense, defense, economy, and combo-enhancing effects.
- ☑ Authored 12 signature abilities with bespoke tuning, payload data, and UI copy.
- ☑ Expanded HUD copy and documentation to surface new mechanics (combo tiers, ability prompts, relic catalog).

## Q4 – Systems Expansion & Live Ops Prep

### Systems
- **Ability Mastery Tracks** – Introduce per-ability mastery that unlocks modifiers (extra charges, alternative effects) through usage challenges.
- **Event Variant Deck** – Author additional arena events (ambush waves, hazard storms, drone beacons) with difficulty scaling knobs.
- **Relic Synergy Matrix** – Implement UI overlays and backend tracking that highlight combos between relic families and weapon keywords.
- **Automated Balancing Telemetry** – Pipe combo tier uptime, relic pick rates, and ability usage into analytics exports for balancing.

### Content
- Draft lore snippets and VO callouts triggered when abilities are activated at max combo tier.
- Create new relic families tied to elemental themes (Frost Bloom, Storm Engine) with escalating art variations.
- Design two mini-boss encounters that explicitly test the new systems (gravity immune juggernaut, drone jamming mage).
